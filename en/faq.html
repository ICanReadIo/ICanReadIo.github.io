				<h2>Does IcanRead work in all countries?</h2>
				<p>Yes it does. It reads over 40 languages. You can try it for free to make sure it reads in the languages you need. When you subscribe, the price will often be in US dollars, but that is just because we have not yet added local currency pricing for all countries.</p>

				<h2>Why can't I find IcanRead on the app store or Google play store?</h2>
				<p>IcanRead is a modern type of app that is called a web app. It runs directly in the browser and there is nothing to dowload or install. That means you can use all your storage for more valuble things like holiday pictures and selfies.</p>

				<h2>Is that a real person reading the text?</h2>
				<p>No but IcanRead uses the best synthetic voices available. They are based on a voice actor and uses very advanced AI so they sound just like a real person.</p>

				<h2>How does IcanRead select what text to read?</h2>
				<p>The algorithm selects the text above where you point. One line at a time is added. When there is a gap to the line above, that is larger than the previous gaps, then no more lines are added. That is how the paragraph is selected. It works well most of the time but every now and then it will not select the paragraph you intended. Tap the screen again then to stop the voice.</p>

				<h2>Can I use the tripod mode even if I don't have a tripod?</h2>
				<p>We don't recommend that. The tripod mode uses artificial intelligence to recognize a pointing finger. It was trained on images from phones in tripods. It will not reliably recognize a pointing finger if the phone is not in a tripod at a 45 degree angle. Use the handheld mode instead.</p>

				<h2>Do you save the images on your server when I read?</h2>
				<p>No, the image is never saved on our servers. We run the process to extract the text and after that the image is discarded. It is never saved on file.</p>

				<h2>Do I need an internet connection to read text?</h2>

				<h2>Can I read texts when I only have mobile internet?</h2>
				<p>Yes you can. If you have a poor connection there will be a longer delay until you hear the sound. If you have limited download available each month then try to be connected to wifi when you read.</p>

				<h2>How many gigabytes of download does it take to read one text?</h2>
				<p>The image upload is abouk 150kB and the sound file download is 100kB-500kB large. That means that if you have 1 GB of free download then you can read at least 2000 paragraphs of text. Reading with IcanRead takes up a lot less download than watching youtube. This only matters if you are on a mobile connection. If you are on wifi it is not an issue.</p>

				<p>Yes we have opted to have the software available for download on our site. It is for your convenience. The app is secure and you will log in with your credentials when you first use it. Just chose to trust the software and run it. Sometimes you need to right-click on the Icanread Icon.</p>

				<h2>When IcanRead Desktop is running in the background on my computer I get the message "Your screen is being recorded". Why is that?</h2>
				<p>Icanread desktop uses the screensharing function that computers provide. It is not recording your screen. When you read a text a screenshot is taken and sent to our cloud servers to extract the text. When IcanRead is in the background it is not in any way analyzing your screen.</p>
