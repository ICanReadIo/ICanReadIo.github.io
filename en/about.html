		<h2 class="subtext editable">POINT AND LISTEN</h2>
		<p>We are passionate about helping dyslexic people cope in life. Text is everywhere and reading is an important skill. We think that every child should practice reading and know that learning to read is possible even with dyslexia. But we also realize that it takes more mental energy to read for a dyslexic than for others. IcanRead is there to help you when your mental energy is running out.
			If you want to know more about IcanRead or perhaps have suggestions please email <a href="mailto:info@IcanRead.io">info@IcanRead.io</a>. We love feedback.</p>

				<h2>How did IcanRead come to be?</h2>
