   - Processing mail and documents

4. **Language Learning:**

   - Reading foreign language texts
   - Learning new vocabulary

### üîë Tips for Success:

1. **Lighting Matters**
   - Ensure good illumination
   - Avoid glare on pages
   - Position light source appropriately

2. **Steady Positioning**
   - Use tripod mode for long sessions
   - Keep phone stable when pointing
   - Maintain consistent distance from text

3. **Practice Makes Perfect**
   - Start with larger text
   - Try different angles
   - Experiment with both modes to find your preference

The technology to point and read text aloud has evolved significantly, and IcanRead represents the current state of the art in this field. Its combination of real-time processing, natural voices, and intuitive pointing interface makes it particularly effective for anyone who needs or prefers to hear text read aloud.
