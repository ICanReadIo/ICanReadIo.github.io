Helping your child feel confident and positive about using assistive devices in social or classroom settings is about creating a safe emotional space, fostering ownership, and ensuring they feel empowered by their tools---not defined by them. Here are some practical, supportive strategies:
### 1. Normalize the Device
- **Use familiar comparisons**: Just like glasses help with vision, assistive tools like text-to-speech apps help with reading. Tools like IcanRead can be described as smart helpers---everyone benefits from different tools.
- **Celebrate real-world examples**: Share stories of students, professionals, or public figures who use assistive devices. When your child sees that many successful people use support tools, it becomes less about what's different and more about what's possible.

### 2. Build Confidence Through Familiarity
- **Practice at home**: Give your child plenty of time to get used to the device. With IcanRead, for example, they can start with books they enjoy, pointing and listening at their own pace.
- **Role-play common situations**: Help your child rehearse how they might explain the tool or respond to questions from classmates. You can even act out scenarios where someone is curious or unsure.

### 3. Empower Choice and Ownership
- **Let them personalize**: Whether it's picking a case for a tablet or choosing between handheld or tripod mode in the IcanRead app, giving choices reinforces a sense of control.
- **Ask how *they* want to present the tool**: Some children feel proud explaining their device, while others prefer it to blend in. Respect their preference.

### 4. Educate the Environment
- **Collaborate with the teacher**: Many educators welcome the chance to support inclusion. A short classroom explanation (guided by your child's comfort level) can go a long way.
- **Explain the *why* of the tool**: Emphasize comprehension and fairness. For instance, IcanRead doesn't make reading easier---it helps level the playing field.

### 5. Cultivate Supportive Friendships
- **Encourage positive peer connections**: Help your child spend time with classmates who are kind and inclusive.
- **Ask the school for inclusive group activities**: Cooperative learning projects or reading groups can help your child feel more involved and successful.

### 6. Check In and Celebrate Progress
- **Ask open-ended questions**: "What was the best part of using your reading app today?" or "Did anyone ask about your device?"
- **Acknowledge their courage**: Even small steps---like using IcanRead aloud in front of a friend---deserve praise.

### 7. Be an Advocate
- **Work with the school**: Make sure staff understand how to support your child's needs.
- **Stand up against teasing or exclusion**: With kindness and clarity, ensure your child knows they're never alone.
Whether it's pointing at a word in a book or using Ctrl+I on the computer, tools like IcanRead can empower your child to thrive in the classroom. The more they experience success with their device, the more natural it becomes---for them and for those around them.
