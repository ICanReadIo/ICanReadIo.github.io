description: "Get the unique perspective of a parent with a dyslexic child. His answer is: Dyslexic children benefit from a variety of evidence-based strategies that improve reading confidence..."
short_answer: "Dyslexic children benefit from a variety of evidence-based strategies that improve reading confidence and foster independence. Structured literacy approaches such as the Orton-Gillingham and Wilson Reading System offer systematic, multi-sensory methods to develop core skills including phonological awareness, decoding, spelling, vocabulary, and comprehension. Incorporating multisensory learning, these strategies involve tactile activities like tracing letters and air-writing words, reinforcing memory and skill retention. The integration of assistive technology is also crucial. Tools like the IcanRead app, which uses advanced text-to-speech technology, empower children to access printed texts, handwritten notes, and digital content independently. Additionally, audiobooks support comprehension and provide alternative access to literature. Explicit phonemic awareness training through sound blending, segmentation, and rhyming exercises builds the foundational skills needed for successful reading. Repeated oral reading practices and scaffolded reading experiences enable children to gradually take responsibility for their learning, while metacognitive strategy instruction and growth mindset feedback enhance reading fluency and self-confidence. Motivation is sustained by connecting reading materials with each child's interests. Together, these approaches offer a robust framework for improving reading abilities in dyslexic children, ensuring every learner has the tools to succeed independently, with IcanRead playing a central role in the process. This comprehensive approach truly transforms learning."
alt_questions:

Yes, there are several evidence-based strategies and techniques proven effective in building reading confidence and independence among dyslexic children. Research highlights the importance of combining structured, supportive methods tailored to the individual learner. Below are strongly supported strategies:

🟢 **1\. Structured Literacy Approaches**

Explicitly teaching phonological awareness, decoding, spelling, vocabulary, and comprehension through a structured and systematic method greatly supports dyslexic readers.

-   **Orton-Gillingham Method**\
    Multi-sensory, structured, and individualized approach, significantly improving reading skills and confidence. *(Ritchey & Goeke, 2006; Stevens et al., 2021)*

-   **Wilson Reading System**\
    Structured phonics and decoding instruction based on Orton-Gillingham principles. *(Duff et al., 2015; Denton et al., 2006)*

🟢 **2\. Multisensory Learning**

Engaging multiple senses simultaneously enhances reading skill retention and understanding.

-   Tracing letters in tactile materials (e.g., sand, shaving foam)

-   Air-writing words

-   Using colored markers or manipulatives *(Shaywitz, 2020; Ritchey & Goeke, 2006)*

🟢 **3\. Assistive Technology and Text-to-Speech (TTS) Tools**

Research strongly supports the use of assistive technology to foster independence and significantly improve reading confidence and comprehension.

-   **Text-to-Speech Apps:** Tools like the **IcanRead** app utilize advanced AI-powered text-to-speech technology, helping children access texts easily by simply pointing at the text---whether in a printed book, handwritten notes, or on-screen text. This aligns closely with studies demonstrating enhanced comprehension and independence through "ear reading" (listening while viewing text). *(Wood et al., 2018; Schneps et al., 2019)*

-   **Audiobooks:** Complement printed text with audio formats to support independent reading.

🟢 **4\. Explicit Phonological and Phonemic Awareness Training**

Explicitly identifying and manipulating sounds within words builds foundational decoding skills.

-   Sound-blending and segmenting activities

-   Rhyming and syllable-counting exercises *(Ehri et al., 2001; National Reading Panel, 2000)*

🟢 **5\. Repeated Oral Reading (Fluency Training)**

Practicing repeated reading of carefully selected, manageable texts greatly improves fluency, accuracy, and confidence.

-   Leveled texts matched to the child's reading skills

-   Supportive modeling and feedback from adults or peers *(Chard et al., 2002; Therrien, 2004)*

🟢 **6\. Scaffolded Reading Experiences**

Structured incremental reading tasks gradually shifting responsibility to the reader fosters greater independence.

-   Paired reading sessions with adults or peers

-   Gradual reduction of adult support over time *(Duke & Pearson, 2002; Fisher & Frey, 2014)*

🟢 **7\. Metacognitive Strategy Instruction**

Teaching comprehension monitoring strategies strengthens independent reading and builds confidence in tackling new texts.

-   Explicit teaching of predicting, summarizing, and clarifying strategies

-   Teacher-led "think-alouds" *(Pressley, 2002; Gunning & Oxford, 2014)*

🟢 **8\. Growth Mindset and Positive Feedback**

Encouraging a growth mindset through positive, strengths-based feedback significantly improves self-confidence and reading motivation.

-   Praise focused on effort and improvement

-   Normalizing mistakes as learning opportunities *(Dweck, 2006; Noltemeyer et al., 2019)*

🟢 **9\. Motivation and Interest-Based Reading**

Selecting personally meaningful, engaging texts boosts motivation, confidence, and sustained independent reading practice.

-   Letting children select preferred formats (comics, graphic novels, audiobooks)

-   Connecting reading content to personal interests *(Guthrie et al., 2007; Wigfield & Eccles, 2000)*
