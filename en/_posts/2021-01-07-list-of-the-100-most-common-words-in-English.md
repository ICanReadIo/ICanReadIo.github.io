Dyslexic children often have trouble reading words they are not familiar with. That will make them read slowly whenever there is a word they do not recognise. We have compiled a list of the 100 most common words in English. You can use this to train your child ,with dyslexia, to recognise those words and make reading them automatic and fast. It will build your child's confidence as they will recognise more words in any text they read.

We have made a pdf document with the words listed three times in different order. Use all 3 lists when your child practices. This will make it less likely that he/she memorizes the order of the word rather than learn to recognise each word.

Please fill in the form below to have the pdf-document emailed to you.
