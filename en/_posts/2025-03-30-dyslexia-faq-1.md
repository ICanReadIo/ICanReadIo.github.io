Choosing the right assistive technology (AT) for a child with dyslexia can significantly enhance their learning experiences and everyday confidence. Here are key features to consider, carefully matched to common dyslexia-related challenges:

**1\. Text-to-Speech (TTS) Capability**

-  **Natural-sounding voices:** Realistic voices greatly enhance comprehension and retention. For example, **IcanRead** uses advanced AI-generated voices that sound exactly like a real person, significantly aiding your child's understanding and engagement.

-  **Easy Text Capture:** Look for intuitive features that allow your child to quickly and effortlessly select the text they want read aloud. Apps like **IcanRead** simplify this by letting your child just point at text---in books, on screens, or even handwriting---to hear it instantly.

-  **Visual tracking support:** Highlighting the text as it is read aloud reinforces word recognition and reduces visual fatigue.

**2\. Speech-to-Text (Dictation)**

-  **Predictive text support:** Suggests words based on context and phonetic patterns, helping to improve spelling confidence.

-  **Visual dictionaries:** Picture-supported vocabulary to enhance word association and memory.

**5\. Organization and Note-Taking**

-  **Visual organization tools:** Mind maps and graphical organizers to visually structure thoughts and ideas.

-  **Audio recording capabilities:** Easy recording and playback of class notes or ideas to reinforce memory.

-  **Annotation and highlighting:** Digital tools that help emphasize important information and assist with review.

**6\. Ease of Use and Accessibility**

-  **Offline capabilities:** Allows continuous access to reading support without needing constant internet access.

**7\. Motivation and Confidence Building**
