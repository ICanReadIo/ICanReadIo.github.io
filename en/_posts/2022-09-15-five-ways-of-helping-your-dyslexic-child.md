1. ### Find out what dyslexia is. 
There are many misconceptions about what dyslexia is and what
it isn't. Sometimes people think that dyslexia is caused by poor parenting or by the child's
teacher. In reality, it's a condition that has nothing to do with IQ. Dyslexia is a learning
disability that can affect reading, writing, spelling, and speech. It can also affect other
aspects of life, such as concentration and organization skills. Experts believe that most cases
of dyslexia are caused by problems in specific areas of the brain. However, the cause of
dyslexia is unknown.
2. ###  Get help for dyslexia. 
If your child has trouble reading and writing, talk to their teacher
about getting extra help. There are professionals who specialize in learning disabilities, and
they can teach you ways to help your child. They can teach them different ways to learn and
how to compensate for their weaknesses. They also can teach special strategies that can
help them read more effectively. You can also hire a professional who specializes in learning
disabilities to help your child. Sometimes a tutor who has experience working with children
who have dyslexia can help a lot.
3. ### Treat the "big" problems first.
Most cases of dyslexia involve trouble with reading fluency
and comprehension. Your child may have trouble identifying words and understanding what
they have just read. They may also have difficulty using context clues to figure out the
meaning of a sentence. Your child can also have trouble writing because of poor spelling,
punctuation, and capitalization.
4. ### Consider using technical tools.
If your child is having trouble reading, there are a number
of technological tools that can help. For example, you can get a program that reads text out
loud for your child. There are also programs that teach your child how to sound out words.
5. ### Boost your child's confidence. 
Teach your child about dyslexia, and explain that it is just a
"learning difference". Help them understand that dyslexia does not define who they are.
