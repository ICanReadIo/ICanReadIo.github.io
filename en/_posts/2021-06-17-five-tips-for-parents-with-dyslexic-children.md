Dyslexia is not an irreversible condition; however, many parents with dyslexic children panic hearing the diagnosis. Think about any skill, e.g., riding a bicycle. Some children will be quick to learn it while others may need training wheels a little longer than their peers. The same is the case with reading and writing skills. While your child may be good at other things, they may be slow in learning to read. It simply means they need the training wheels a little longer than expected. So, here are 5 scientifically proven tips that the parents could use in order to help their dyslexic child.

1. ### Intervene as early as possible.  
Dyslexia could be diagnosed as soon the child starts going to school; around age 5-6 years old. Therefore, if you see your child struggling with their homework, discuss your observations and concerns with your child’s teacher and pediatrician as early as possible. While it is very likely that your child is disinterested, it is also quite possible that he/she may need additional support. Researchers suggest that the sooner a dyslexic child is enrolled in a proactive training program, the better they will be able to improve their learning skills.  Therefore, do not take the signs lightly or wait for them to worsen. Intervene as soon as possible.
2. ###  Support and encourage your child. 
Your dyslexic children could be struggling internally as they themselves may not understand what is going on with them. They try and try yet they never succeed, unlike their peers. It may be frustrating enough on its own. Therefore, being parents allow your child to make mistakes. Highlight their strengths, reinforce their attempts, and display unconditional love. Doing so may increase their self-esteem and confidence. It will also add to their psychological well-being. Moreover, look out for bullying and report such incidents to the school authority to protect your child’s psychological and physical health.
3. ### Be creative.
Children with dyslexia learn better as they experience. Therefore, get innovative and creative with their academic activities at home. For example, parents could play scrabble to teach spellings. Decodable books are another useful tool to help your child in learning how to read. Moreover, parents can use books with plenty of colorful images and minimum text, or even comic books, to encourage the act of reading itself.

4. ### Learn with them.
It’s difficult for dyslexic children to finish their work on their own. Therefore, join them while they study. Besides supervising your child’s academic activities, you may also pretend to be their student. Allowing them to repeat and teach what they just learned may strengthen their skills. You can also encourage them to read storybooks before bedtime.
5. ### Arrange a tutor. 
While some parents may be available to supervise their child’s academic activities at home, many other working parents may find it hard to take on an additional duty. However, children with dyslexia need constant supervision with their work. Therefore, hiring a tutor expert in dealing with your child’s condition could help.
