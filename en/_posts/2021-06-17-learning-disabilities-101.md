Learning disabilities that can affect reading are more prevelant than people think.
Becoming aware of the warning signs of learning disabilities and getting children the necessary help early on
can be key to a child’s future.

The earlier a learning disability is detected, the better chance a child will have of succeeding in school and
in life. Parents are encouraged to understand the warning signs of a learning disability from as early as preschool. The first years in school are especially crucial for a young child.

## Dyslexia
> Dyslexia is not a disease to have and to be cured of, but a way of thinking
and learning. Often it’s a gifted mind waiting to be found and taught.

Girard Sagmiller, “Dyslexia My Life”

### WHAT IS DYSLEXIA?
Dyslexia is difficulty in the use and processing of linguistic and symbolic codes, alphabetic letters representing speech sounds or numeric representing numbers or quantities. It can affect spoken language, written language and language comprehension. Dyslexia is the most-common learning disability, affecting nearly 10 percent of the population, despite intelligence, motivation, and education. While not the result of neurological damage, it is the product of neurological development. Dyslexia commonly runs in families and varies from mild to severe. Children don’t outgrow dyslexia, and adults with dyslexia suffer emotionally and financially because of it.

### DYSLEXIA’S EFFECTS ON READING
- Very slow progress in acquiring reading skills
- The lack of a strategy to read new words
- Trouble reading unknown (new, unfamiliar) words that must be sounded out; making wild stabs or guesses at reading a word; failure to systematically sound out words
- The inability to read small “function” words such as that, an, in
- Stumbling on reading multi-syllabic words, or the failure to come close to sounding out the full word
- Omitting parts of words when reading; the failure to decode parts within a word,as if someone had chewed a hole in the middle of the word, such as conible for convertible
