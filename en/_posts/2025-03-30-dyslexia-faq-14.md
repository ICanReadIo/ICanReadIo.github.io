Yes, AI can absolutely read aloud what you point at—and with the right tools, it's already changing lives.
One of the most impactful implementations of this is the **IcanRead app**, which is designed to support people with dyslexia. It uses advanced AI to recognize finger pointing and convert printed or digital text into natural-sounding speech in real time.
### How it works:
- **Tripod Mode**: Place your phone on a stand, open a book, and simply point at the text. IcanRead sees your finger and starts reading the text aloud—perfect for study sessions.
- **Handheld Mode**: Hold your phone, aim the camera at any text, tap, and listen. Great for quick access to reading.
- **Screen Mode**: Installed on your computer, you just point with your mouse and press Ctrl+I to hear any on-screen text.
IcanRead supports a wide range of languages and uses AI voices that sound like real people, improving both comprehension and comfort for users.

While other technologies (like Seeing AI or Google Lookout) provide similar capabilities using general-purpose OCR and TTS tools, **IcanRead stands out by focusing on the specific needs of people with dyslexia**, combining user-friendly design with highly accurate pointing recognition.
It's a powerful tool to level the learning field—whether you're reading from a textbook, a screen, or even handwritten notes.
