Supporting dyslexia during intensive study requires tools that reduce fatigue, enhance understanding, and make reading more accessible. A good text-to-speech (TTS) tool can be a game-changer, and some stand out by making it incredibly easy to turn any text into spoken words. Here are the key features to look for:

✅ **1. Simplicity**  

The most powerful feature can also be the simplest. Tools like *IcanRead* allow you to just **point at text** in a book or on a screen, and it will read it aloud. No scanning, no copying --- just instant reading support when you need it. This removes friction and helps you stay in the flow while studying.

✅ **2. High-Quality, Natural-Sounding Voices**  

Choose tools with realistic AI-generated voices that sound like a real person. *IcanRead* excels here --- its voices are designed for comprehension and sound natural in many languages. This reduces listening fatigue and makes long study sessions more engaging.

✅ **3. Multimodal Input (Books, Screens, Handwriting)** 

Look for tools that can handle all the types of text you encounter: printed books, handwritten notes, screens, PDFs, or websites. *IcanRead* supports all of these. Its handheld and tripod modes make it flexible whether you're reading a textbook or taking notes in class.

✅ **4. Screen Reading for Digital Study**  

A good TTS tool should help you study from digital sources, too. *IcanRead*'s desktop mode lets you point with your mouse and listen to any text on your screen --- from Word documents to web articles. Just press Ctrl+I and the reading begins.

✅ **5. Adjustable Reading Speed**  

Everyone processes spoken information at different speeds. Make sure your TTS tool lets you adjust speed to suit your focus level.

✅ **6. Visual Support: Highlighting & Tracking**  

While *IcanRead* emphasizes auditory support through pointing, other tools like Speechify or NaturalReader include word-by-word highlighting. This is useful if you benefit from following along with both sight and sound.

✅ **7. Multi-Device Support**  

You might switch between phone, tablet, and computer. *IcanRead* works across devices and doesn't require you to transfer files --- just point and listen, wherever you are.

✅ **8. Designed with Dyslexia in Mind**  

Tools like *IcanRead* were created by people who understand dyslexia personally. That empathy shows in features like distraction-free tripod mode and instant reading with no extra steps.

✅ **9. Language Support**  

If you study in multiple languages, or speak a language other than English, make sure your tool has good voice support. *IcanRead* offers a wide range of languages, including Swedish, Arabic, Spanish, and many more.
