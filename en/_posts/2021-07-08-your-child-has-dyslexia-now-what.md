1. ### Tell your child that there is help 
Problems in school can make children feel lonely and feel bad about themselves. Let your child know that you are working with a teacher to find the best ways to help. Knowing that skills can be improved will help your child stay motivated.

2. ### Look for patterns
Keep track of what happens when your child reads and write down what you see. You may be able to pick up patterns. For example, is it more difficult for your child to make out some words than others? The more you notice, the more information you can share with the teachers.

3. ### Build a support network  
When you take steps to help your child, support is also important to you. Try to talk openly about your child's problems to people you trust. You can also connect with other families in a secure, understanding community. There are lots of Dyslexia support groups on Facebook.

4. ### Find ways to help at home
There are many ways to develop reading skills at home. Discover strategies that you can try. But don't just focus on problems. Help your child celebrate great and small gains in reading or any other activity.
